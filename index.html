			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<h3 id="General">General</h3>
			<p>The following factors were established in the Web Proposal in the previous assignment. <br><br> OBJECTIVE: <br> It is important to first revise the objective of this new site: <strong>provide information</strong>. The purpose of thie site is that it is informative - it is <strong>content-rich</strong>. Thorough research - from Mental Health Foundation Australia itself and many other secondary sources - was conducted to gather information that populates the site. Ultimately, <strong>learning through subtle interactivity</strong> is the primary call-to-action. <br><br>
			TARGET AUDIENCE:<br> This remains as two major age groups - <strong>Young Persons (15-24 years old)</strong> and <strong>Middle-Aged (45-54 years old)</strong>, as determined in user research. They are the two groups most vulnerable to mental health illnesses.     - Information is <strong>catered to them specifically.</strong> For example, in “Who to Approach”, the organisations listed are specific to their needs, and the websites that are linked externally have these two parties as their own target audience. This will be explained further later.<br><br>
			FORM:<br> The aesthetic of the page, despite it being an informative page, is to be kept as <strong>minimalistic</strong>. Therefore many words are hidden from user’s main view unless hovered or clicked. There was also an attempt to keep a <strong>balanced and symmetrical organisation of information, with a line about centre y-axis</strong>. The corners of all containers and images are also <strong>rounded</strong>. With less sharp edges, I wanted to make the site <strong>more welcoming and friendly</strong>, particularly so for its purpose as a mental health site.<br><br>
			COLOUR: <br> The colour scheme follows the palette determined in the proposal - purple, blue and yellow, or <strong>split complementary colour palette</strong>. This aims to <strong>encourage easy-reading but also convey hope</strong> to individuals struggling with mental health. <br><br>
			MEDIA QUERIES: <br>The site was coded for <strong>an iPhone X first</strong>, then scaled up to the desktop size, compatible with a <strong>Macbook Pro.</strong><br><br>
			The <strong>process of developing the 4 pages</strong> is as follows:
			<blockquote>
				Landing Page > About Us Page > Information Page > Information Sub Page
			</blockquote>
			
		</p>
			<h3 id="Landing">Landing Page</h3>
			<p>The Landing Page is key to <strong>showing the options</strong> that the user can select. Therefore, <strong>the icons, showing the information (and hence subpages)</strong> are the key focus. The graphical icons are created using bright colours and a fun design, so as to encourage users to select them.
			<br><br>

				<figcaption>Previous Version of Landing Page of Website</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Landing Page.png" alt="Landing Page of site" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Final Version Landing Page of Website</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><ul>Key Points:
				<li><strong>Home and Emergency Contact</strong> to be stayed throughout <strong>all pages</strong> - so that user can access the home (landing) page and make an emergency call if needed (feeling overwhelmed).</li>
				<li>The footer, which shows a quote that promotoes hope, will also be displayed throughout all the pages.</li>
				<li><strong>Comparing the Previous and Final Landing Pages</strong>, there was a <strong>slight change (iteration)</strong>. Through user feedback, it was understood that the thinner, single-lined border is not strong enough to accentuate the organisation. Because of its thinness, it was also prompting user to select an element within the container. </li>
				<li>The border is then changed to <strong>a thicker, double-lined border.</strong> The double border acts as a restriction - like a double barrier or double yellow line on the roads - user is less likley to select an element within the page.</li>
				<li>Border is <strong>dotted</strong> around all icons to indicate that the user can possibly select them. This differentiates them from the top header graphic.</li>
				<li><strong>Hovering</strong> causes text to <strong>change colour</strong>, indicating to the user that it can be selected. Not only the text is selectable - its container too. This gives space for users to make mistakes.</li>
				<li><strong>Transitions:</strong> The <strong>graphic headers</strong> in the individual subpages (e.g. the graphics at the top of About Us and Information pages) are <strong>matched</strong> to the <strong>icons</strong> on the Landing Page.  This <strong>gives continuity</strong> and let the user better understand that he selected that icon/page previously.</li>
			</ul></p>

			<h3 id="About">"About Us" Page</h3>
			<p>The About Us Page is important to <strong>showcasing facts about the organisation</strong>. Often, it is mislooked by viewers because they are more concerned over the content that the site will be showing. However, I felt that it was important to showcase <strong>how this organisation is different from other organisations.</strong></p>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/About Us Page.png" alt="About Us Page" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>About Us Page</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><ul>Key Points:
				<li>Information about Mental Health Foundation Australia was <strong>sieved out carefully, particularly the objectives they wish to promote and the members on the board</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Images of members</strong> of the board are added to match faces with names - making the information easier to relate to, and friendlier!  </li>
				<li>I felt that it was important to showcase these information and how they are different from other organisations. The interesting fact is that <strong> Mental Health Foundation is the oldest establishment that aims to advocate mental wellbeing in Australia!</strong> Therefore, its history was summarised briefly.</li>
				<li>Just like the previous Landing Page, there was an attempt to centralise the content about the central y-axis, further emphasising the importance of <strong>balance.</strong></li>
			</ul></p>

			<h3 id="Information">"Information" Page</h3>
			<p>This page could be described as a “selection page”. Users can click and then be directed directly to the information that they want in another subsequent page.</p>
			<figure>

				<img src="assets/Text Container Hover.png" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Text Container when Mouse Hovers over Graphic</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><ul>Key Points:
				<li>This Information Page is kept <strong>minimalistic</strong>. For a start, it has three square graphic blocks. In this above scenario, only the Young Person's graphic is added in as a prototype.</li>
				<li>When users hover over the blocks, the <strong>text container</strong> will appear, allowing user to make a selection.</li>
				<li> This made use of <code>a href</code> tags in the lists, contained in the text containers.</li>
				<li>When the mouse hovers over the text, the colour changes to <strong>indicate that the words are clickable</strong>. The colour of the hovered-over text also follows the <strong>colour theme</strong> of the site, but also ensuring that it caters to those <strong>who may be colour blind</strong>. This improves accessibility.</li>
			</ul></p>

			<h3 id="Information_Sub">"Information Sub" Page</h3>
			<p>This page is where the <strong>bulk of the content and information</strong> will be. This is the <strong>most developed page</strong>. As mentioned at the beginning, the objective of this site is to help users learn. Therefore, <strong>facts and figures</strong> are important to encorurage that.</p>
			<figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Information Sub Page Hover 2.png" alt="Information Sub Page for Young Persons" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Information Displayed when Hovered over Middle-Aged Container</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><ul>Key Points:
				<li>This Information Sub Page is also <strong>minimalistic</strong> too. Despite having a lot of information, they are kept away from sight in their own containers unless an event happens.</li>
				<li>I was inspired by flash cards - where in real life, users will flip cards over to reveal the answers. This also ensures that <strong>information is disgestible</strong>. Because flash cards are often limited in physical space, I wanted to display information to <strong>educate</strong>, but kept succinct.</li>
				<li>When users hover over the blocks, the <strong>text container</strong> will appear, allowing user to make a selection.</li>
				<li> This made use of <code>a href</code> tags in the lists, contained in the text containers.</li>
				<li>I wanted users to <strong>view only one piece of information at once</strong>, therefore only having access to one container at a time. Therefore, <code>:hover</code> was used the most across the page.</li>
				<li><strong>Colour-coding</strong> was used, based on the majority of the colour used for <strong>icon selection graphic</strong> in the previous page. For example, blue was used the most for the young, and orange was used for the middle-aged. Subsequently, purple will be used for carers.</li>
				<li>As seen in the above two screenshots, the content displayed for Young Persons (15 to 24 years old) and the Middle-Aged (45 to 54 years old) do differ. For example:
						<ul>
							<li>The amount of text displayed for Young Persons is significantly less. This is to cater to an audience with <strong>shorter attention span</strong>, who are less likely to reading big amount of texts.</li>
							<li>Because of the longer text shown for the Middle-Aged, <strong>bolding of keywords</strong> was used to showcase more important information. This helps make the information skimmable as well.</li>
						</ul>
				</li>
			</ul></p>

			<h2>Process</h2>
			<p>This section explains how the website is created, in more detail.</p>

			<h3 id="Pre_Coding">Step 1</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 1.png" alt="Step 1: Importing of Fonts" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 1: Importing of Futura Fonts</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>As established in the Web Proposal, the Futura font was best suited for the theme of the site. It was also important to code an extra "backup" font, just in case  the browser does not support the Futura font, or if any other problems arise. </p>

			<h3>Step 2</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 2.png" alt="Step 2: Creating Nav Bars and Relative URLs" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 2: Creating Nav Bars and Relative URLs</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The navigation bars for the top (i.e. Home and Emergency Contact) and the content were created at this point. The <code>a href</code> tags were used to link between the different pages.</p>

			<h3>Step 3</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 3.png" alt="Step 3: Changing the CSS of the Navigation Bars" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 3: Changing the CSS of the Navigation Bars</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>After the first experimentation of the styling of the navigation bars, the colour palette for the site was used to change the background and text colour of bars.</p>

			<h3>Step 4</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 4.png" alt="Step 4: Exporting the Graphic Assets" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 4: Exporting the Graphic Assets</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The graphics used for the top header of every page and in directory for content were created in Adobe Illustrator. Hence, the assets were then exported in SVG format, so that they are compatible to the resizing of the browser (responsiveness).</p>

			<h3>Step 5</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 5.png" alt="Step 5: Importing Graphics into 'assets' Folder and Creating div Tags for Graphic Headers" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 5: Importing Graphics into 'assets' folder and Creating <code>div</code> tags for Graphic Headers</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Once the assets were imported into my own local folder, it is then imported into Visual Studio Code (VSC) so that they can be used later. The graphics were first trialed using the Landing Page. <br> <em>Note:</em> the above graphic was later replaced using the logo of the Mental Health Foundation Australia because it better protrayed this site as a representative of the organisation.</p>

			<h3 id="Landing_Page_Process">Step 6</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 6.png" alt="Step 6: Landing Page - Making Use of div Tags, Titles and Graphics to Direct to Other Pages" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 6: Landing Page - Making Use of <code>div</code> Tags, Titles and Graphics to Direct to Other Pages</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>As explained earlier, the graphic icons were the key focus of the Landing Page. Therefore, multiple <code>div</code> tags were created - with a shared <code>class</code> - so that they can be styled simultaneously. Because the graphic icons and titles were housed in their own  containers, it was useful in coding and allowing users to select any part of this entire container to be directed. This allows for user error in selection.</p>

			<h3>Step 7</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 7.png" alt="Step 7: Addition of the General Statistics and Creation of Footer" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 7: Addition of the General Statistics and Creation of Footer</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Because the purpose of the site was to give information, I felt that it was important to showcase the general statistics of the mental health status in Australia. This led on to the concluding statement of "You are not alone.", so as to encourage users to step forth and be part of a community. In the same vein, a footer was created to push forth the idea of courage and recovery. This quote was written by Shakespeare, and it showed in a simple line, the power of one's own will.</p>

			<h3 id="Information_Page_Process">Step 8</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 8.png" alt="Step 8: Information Page - Creating It and Copying Over the Navigation Bars and Footer" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 8: Information Page - Creating It and Copying Over the Navigation Bars and Footer</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The HTML and CSS for the Information Page was created, alongside a general format of the page using <code>div</code> tags. Since the navigation bars and footer were to be consistent across all the pages, their codes (both HTML and CSS) were copied over from the Landing Page.</p>

			<h3>Step 9</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 9.png" alt="Step 9: Information Page - Adding Graphic Header Similar to the Graphic Icon Landing Page" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 9: Information Page - Adding Graphic Header Similar to the Previous Graphic Icon Landing Page</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The top graphic header of this Information Page, that is similar to that of graphic icon in the previous Landing Page, was added. This gives a quick introduction the page even before the user looks at the general word-written content. </p>

			<h3>Step 10</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 10i.png" alt="Step 10i: Previous Version of the Information Page" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 10i: Information Page - Previous Version of the Information Page</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The previous version saw that the graphic icon and the text container be presented in two columns. However, feedback was given on how this may not be the best for user experience, particularly for users who are older and may not be able to see clerly.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 10ii.png" alt="Step 10ii: Final Version of the Information Page" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 10ii: Final Version of the Information Page</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Using the feedback given, the graphic icons and text containers are displayed in a single block column instead. This was for ease of reading and selection.</p>

			<h3>Step 11</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 11.png" alt="Step 11: Styling the Text Container" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 11: Styling the Text Container</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The text container was given a dotted border. This was consistent with the style that was used on the Landing Page. The text was also a blue colour to give a good contrast with the white background.</p>

			<h3 id="Information_Sub_Page_Process">Step 12</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 12.png" alt="Step 12: Sections Created for Each Target Audience" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 12: Information Sub Page - Sections Created for Each Target Audience</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>For the possibility of differing styling and organisation, the content for Young Persons, Middle-Aged and Carers were put into different sections.</p>

			<h3>Step 13</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 13.png" alt="Step 13: Information Sub Page - Subsequent Divisions Created within Each Section" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 13: Information Sub Page - Subsequent Divisions Created within Each Section</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>For each part of the information (i.e. General, Common Types of Struggles, How to Overcome Them and Who to Approach), they were put into a bigger container using <code>div</code> tags. This was also for better organisations of information.</p>
			
			<h3>Step 14</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 14.png" alt="Step 14: Information Sub Page - Each Part of Information" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 14: Information Sub Page - Each Part of Information</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Each part of the information (i.e. General, Common Types of Struggles, How to Overcome Them and Who to Approach) are now given their own unique <code>id</code> tag. This was done, so that in the future, if the style for each card is to be different, it can be coded.</p>

			<h3>Step 15</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 15.png" alt="Step 15: Making Use of the Hover Function" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 15: Information Sub Page - Making Use of the Hover Function</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>As explained earlier, as I wanted the the information to be presented like flash cards, the hover function was used across the individual containers (with the id tags). </p>

			<h3>Step 16</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 16.png" alt="Step 16: Paragraph Texts Kept Shorter for This Age Group" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 16: Information Sub Page - Paragraph Texts Kept Shorter for This Age Group</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>For Young Persons (15 to 24 years old), content nested inside the flash cards is less.</p>

			<h3>Step 17</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 17.png" alt="Step 17: Display Format Repeated" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 17: Information Sub Page - Display Format Repeated</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The display format for the Middle-Aged age group was repeated from that of the Young Persons age group.</p>

			<h3>Step 18</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 18.png" alt="Step 18: More Content in Paragraphs for This Age Group" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 18: Information Sub Page - More Content in Paragraphs for This Age Group</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>For Middle-Aged (45 to 54 years old), facts and figures are key to be persuasive. This appeals to their Logos, or logical reasoning. However, keywords were still bolded to ensure that they are still convenient and efficient to read.</p>

			<h3 id="media_queries_process">Step 19</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 19.png" alt="Step 19: Media Queries Added for Responsiveness" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 19: Media Queries Added for Responsiveness</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Once most content was settled, media queries was added to make the website responsive. In this project, it will be for the iPhone X and the Macbook Pro.</p>
	
			<h3>Step 20</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="assets/Step 20.png" alt="Step 20: Media Queries Added for Responsiveness Across Other Pages" width="200px" height="auto" ></iframe>
				<figcaption>Step 20: Media Queries Added for Responsiveness Across Other Pages</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Media queries were added across all other pages. They were added in this order: Information Sub Page, Information Page, Landing Page and About Us Page. This was determined based on the priority of these pages. </p>

			<h3 id="future">Future Improvements and Development</h3>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Generate information for Carers</li>
					<li>Make use of CSS or Javascript animations instead of merely hover effects</li>
					<li>Make use of <code>:active</code> - make information stay on page so user can look across and compare multiple pieces of information</li>
					<li>Make use of Javascript code - code more responsive sites with better event functions</li>
					<li>Develop a Blog Page - give more information</li>
					<li>Develop a Log In/Register Page as the second Call-to-Action - users can make appointments or participate in community events</li>
					<li>Develop a Find Support Page - users can connect to online platforms or choose to attend events for their own age groups</li>
				</ul>
